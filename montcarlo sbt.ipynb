    "### 📐 Custom Order Parameters: `q` and `p`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we introduce two **problem-specific order parameters** — `q` and `p` — designed to summarize the global state of signed networks during Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are rooted in concepts from statistical physics and network science, and were specifically developed for analyzing **structural balance** and **interaction patterns** in systems like social or brain networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 `p`: Mean Link Strength (Interaction Order Parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "`p` is a statistical measure of the **average signed interaction strength** in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is computed as the ratio of the sum of signed links to the sum of their absolute values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p = \\frac{\\sum_{i < j} A_{ij}}{\\sum_{i < j} |A_{ij}|}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( A_{ij} \\) is the weight of the link between nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A value close to +1 indicates a highly **cooperative** or **correlated** network.\n",
    "- A value close to -1 indicates strong **conflict** or **anti-correlation**.\n",
    "- It serves as an **order parameter** to detect changes in the average polarity of interactions as the system evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 `q`: Two-Star Motif Alignment (Structural Order Parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "`q` is a structural parameter based on **two-star motifs** — configurations where two links share a common node (i.e., `j → i → k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is calculated as the normalized sum of the product of link pairs forming two-step paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "q = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\neq k} A_{ji} \\cdot A_{ik}}{\\sum_{j \\neq k} |A_{ji} \\cdot A_{ik}|}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- High positive values of `q` reflect **alignment** or **structural coherence** across indirect paths.\n",
    "- Values near zero suggest **randomness** or **imbalance** in the network.\n",
    "- This metric is especially useful for capturing **indirect conflicts** or **frustrated loops**, which are critical in understanding complex systems like brain networks or social dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `q` and `p` act as **order parameters**, providing insight into the macroscopic state of the system and how it transitions across temperatures or conditions in the Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are designed specifically for this project and are meaningful in the context of **signed networks**, **structural balance theory**, and **higher-order network interactions**.\n"
